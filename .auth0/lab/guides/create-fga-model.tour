You can see a model defined above using the DSL language. This model defines two **object** types: `user` and `doc`. \n\nThere are also two **relations** defined:\n\n**`define owner: [user]`** specifies that an object of `user` type can be an `owner` of a `doc`.\n\n**`define viewer: [user, user:*]`** specifies that an object of `user` can be an `viewer` of a `doc`, and `user:*` indicates that it's possible for **every user** in the system can be a viewer of a `doc`. \n\n>It's important to note that the model expresses **possible** relationships between object types. Actual relationships between particular users and docs must be defined later as **relationship tuples**.",

Select the **+ Add Tuple** button.\n3. Fill in the following values:\n    - User:  **user:***\n    - Object: select **doc** and add **public-doc** in the ID field\n    - Relation: **viewer**\n4.
